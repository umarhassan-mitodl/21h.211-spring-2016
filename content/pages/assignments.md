Unit Papers
-----------

Over the course of the semester, students will be required to turn in three short papers, each 4–6 pages in length. Each paper will respond to one of the six course units listed in the {{% resource_link ef94033c-deaf-5cbb-3b08-46ac614dd617 "Calendar" %}} section. Students may choose which three units to write on.

Papers should be structured around an analysis of one or more primary sources assigned over the course of the unit. Papers will be due on the Friday following the last class meeting for each unit.

Though the focus of each paper should be the student's analysis of primary sources, successful papers will draw on—and make connections between—assigned materials from the entire unit (this includes secondary sources, primary sources, and films).

Each unit paper is worth 15% of the overall course grade. Papers will be graded according to the quality of the argument presented, the strength of the evidence marshaled in support of that argument, and the clarity and quality of written expression (this includes style, grammar, and proper citation).

Final Essay
-----------

The longer essay may be either an independent research paper on a topic relevant to course themes or a final paper that contains a topic discussed during individual meetings with the professor.

The final paper is worth 30% of the overall course grade.
