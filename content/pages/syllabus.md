## Course Description

This subject examines the unique culture that developed in the United States after World War II. The dawn of the nuclear age and the ensuing Cold War fundamentally altered American politics and social life. It also led to a flowering of technological experimentation and rapid innovation in the sciences. Over the course of the term we will explore how Americans responded to these changes, and how those responses continue to shape life in the U.S. today.

Topics under consideration include new family structures and civil defense strategies that emerged in response to the promise and perils of nuclear power; the role of anxiety and insecurity in transforming American politics; the development of computing technology and the changes it brought to American workspaces; the social impacts of space exploration, suburbanization, and the construction of highways and shopping malls; the global and domestic repercussions of decolonization in a Cold War context; the emergence of dissent in the form of student, environmentalist, and anti-nuclear protest movements; and the legacies of nuclear power and Cold War at home and abroad.

## Resources and Policies

*Writing Assistance*

The {{% resource_link "a729d8ba-ae25-4c85-b63b-a044f9d3f0ad" "Writing and Communication Center" %}} at MIT offers free one-on-one professional advice to MIT students from lecturers who are published writers and experienced college teachers. They offer assistance with all types of academic, creative, and professional writingâ€”including papers, applications, theses, and CVs. They also offer oral presentation assistance and help with all English as Second Language issues (from writing and grammar, to pronunciation and conversation practice).

*Cheating and Plagiarism*

MIT has strict policies against plagiarism. In academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to draw any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source. It doesn't matter whether the source is a published author, a website without clear authorship, a website that sells academic papers, or another student. Taking credit for someone else's work is unacceptable in all academic situations, whether you do it intentionally or by accident. In my experience, most cases of plagiarism are not intentional, and instead arise out of confusion concerning what counts as plagiarism and how to avoid it. To protect yourself from accidentally becoming a plagiarist, and to learn more about what constitutes plagiarism, read {{% resource_link "ff511f89-d784-44b2-9857-bbc0731c75bf" "Academic Integrity at MIT: A Handbook for Students" %}} or contact me directly.

*Note on Content*

Over the course of the term we will discuss events and concepts that may be disturbing or traumatizing to some students. Please read the syllabus closely before the start of the term. If you suspect that specific material is likely to be emotionally challenging for you, I'd be happy to discuss any concerns you may have before the topic comes up in class.
